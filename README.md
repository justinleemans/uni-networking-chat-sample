# UniNetworking chat console sample

A simple console based chat app sample project. This project is a sample project to show the capability of my custom event based networking solution to be included in native .Net applications. The repository for this library can be found [here](https://github.com/justinleemans/uni-networking).

The binary used in this repository was compiled manually and can be found [ChatSample/Plugins](ChatSample/Plugins). Compiling this binary is relativly easy and was done by running the dotnet build command on the package repository.
